# python_automation_scripts
This repo contains some python scripts I used to carry out some tasks on my local machine.

These scripts were used to carry out the following tasks:
1) Create a MS Excel sheet containing the number of pages of several books.
2) Adjust the time of subscript files (.srt files) for the popular series Mr. Robot.
3) Confirm the number of downloaded files about molecular structures (downloaded from [ZINC15](http://zinc.docking.org/)) are the same as the ones I specified in the download page.
